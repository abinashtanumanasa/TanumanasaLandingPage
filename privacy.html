                    <p>
                        CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.<br><br>
                        According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:<br><br>
                        0.1. users can visit our site anonymously;<br><br>
                        0.2. our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be found on the home page of our website;<br><br>
                        0.3. users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page;<br><br>
